# Mini project SAF (ros2)
this is the repository for the mini project along with the coding bits from the exercises.

Git etiquette:

use ADD when adding files

Use REMOVE when removing files:

use CHANGE when changing files.

Use snake_case when naming commits, such as "ADD IMU sensor package" and when naming packages.

Stabke main, make branches when making changes, and make sure that the group is agreed when the main is changed.
